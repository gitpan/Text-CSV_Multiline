Text-CSV_Multiline version 0.02
===============================

This is a very simple comma-separated-value (CSV) file reader
and writer. At the time it was created, the standard Text::CSV
module could not handle fields that had embedded newline codes, thus
this module was written which could handle "multiple lines" in a
single CSV field.

It appears that newer versions of Text::CSV have added the capability,
though I have not tested it to see if it meets my needs. Anyway, I
already have several projects that use this module, so I am maintaining
this for just a little longer.
